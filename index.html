	       I am a 21 year old Jamaican national who is interested in sporting activities, baking, moneymaking and women. I 
	       would like to be a party promoter in the future if Jah wills it. Also I would
	       to be a philantropist as well, so that I may give back to society and help others. I am interested in learning 
	       web development because it is a essential skill to have in the modern era that is heavily reliant on the internet and technology
